                Each and every Friday night we converse at the rec club for Games Night. Kicking off about 7:00pm for some pool, table tennis, darts or backgammon. In the warmer months you might also possibly see a bit of cornhole or croquet.
            </p>
            <p style="max-width: 80%; margin-bottom: 1em">
                About once a month we also have a BBQ where we see some friends from town pop down.
            </p>
            <p style="max-width: 80%; margin-bottom: 1em">
                Feel free to pop on down one Friday evening, everyone is welcome. $2 for members and $4 for non members. People will also generally bring some nibbles to share.
