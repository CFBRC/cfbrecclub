                Our first event was in May 2021 for the Cancer Council Biggest Morning Tea.
            </p>
            <p style="max-width: 80%; margin-bottom: 1em">
                The event was well attended and enjoyed by all so we decided to hold a morning tea each year but for different local charities. The charities we have supported have been Meals on Wheels Huon Valley Hardship Fund (July 2022), Rural Alive and Well (June 2023), and Speak Up! Stay ChatTY (June 2024).
            </p>
            <p style="max-width: 80%; margin-bottom: 1em">
                For each we have had a representative from the charity to join us. A highlight of two of the events was when a large group rowed down from Franklin to join us. Besides fundraising, the morning teas also raise awareness of the charity and provide an enjoyable, social community event.
