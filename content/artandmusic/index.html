			Last year we saw over 60 fabulous artist entries on display, a full weekend of accomplished and talented musicians entertained while one siped on Heriots Point Wines or beers from our bar, accompanied by a cheese platter, a plate of sandwiches for lunch, or even the divine Sanger in bread. Many enjoyed the weekend in culturally artistic euphoria!! Not to mention Yeastie Beastie for our favourite Huon Valley sourdough doughnuts and Que Sera Sera for that all important morning coffee.

            This year is shaping up to be even bigger and better again! Stay tuned for further information as it comes to hand.
