			            The Castle Forbes Bay Recreation Club is located in Meredith Street,  Castle Forbes Bay. The clubhouse and grounds occupy an area of great natural beauty on the banks of the Huon River with expansive views amid a rural setting. It is handy to the Huon Highway yet quiet and private.
					</p>
					<p style="max-width: 80%; margin-bottom: 1em">
						The facility has been held in trust for the local community for over 90 years. It was mainly used as a cricket oval and clubhouse by the original Castle Forbes Bay Cricket Club and recently by the Southern Tigers Cricket Club. 
					</p>
			        <p style="max-width: 80%; margin-bottom: 1em">
			            Southern Tigers withdrew from management of the facilities, so in February 2019 the local community stepped in and the Castle Forbes Bay Recreation Club Inc was formed to ensure that the clubhouse and grounds would have a viable future as a recreation centre. It is managed by a volunteer committee of local residents in conjunction with the trustees.
			        </p>
			        <p style="max-width: 80%; margin-bottom: 1em">
			            The community has organised a number of events and fundraisers as well as acquiring grants to pay for the upkeep and upgrading of the clubhouse and ground. Some of these include a Community BBQ, 2020 Calendar; Trivia Nights, a Garage Sale, Ciderbrations (an event to celebrate cider making in the local area), Beginners cider making, regular Friday Games Night, Art and Music Exhibition, Solstice cemetery walk and bbq, Charity morning tea, Christmas celebration, especially “the Lonnnng table”, and other exciting events.
			        </p>
					<p style="max-width: 80%; margin-bottom: 3em">
			            This is just the beginning. We want this wonderful venue to become a hub for the community and continue to thrive. So, if you would like to become a member, get involved or use the club or grounds, we'd love to hear from you.
